$$\blacksquare\underline{\bold{OBSERVATIONS}} \bold{:-}$$
$$\bold{i.}$$ when we first saw the $$\bold{Ciphertext}$$, we assumed it to be a substitution cipher, and a simple substitution cipher with frequency analysis $$\bold{failed}$$ to decrypt the message.

$$\bold{ii.}$$ After entering  $$\bold{"GO"}$$ command, there is a $$\bold{hint}$$ provided in the last line which says $$\underline{\bold{"PLAY FAIR"}}$$., this lead to the thought of $$\bold{PLAYFAIR \space CIPHER.}$$

$$\bold{iii.}$$ A key observation in Ciphertext is $$\bold{ no \space two \space letters \space in \space a \space digraph \space are \space the \space same}$$ which confirmed that PLAY FAIR makes the encryption.
(a possible case would be "XX" present in plain text but not available in the given ciphertext).

$$\bold{iv. \space KEY }$$ for playcipher is also provided as a $$\bold{hint}$$, but in $$\bold{"MORSE CODE"}$$, which we decrypted and found out to be $$\bold{"CRYPTANALYSIS".}$$ 

$$\bold{v.}$$ To confirm and check the correctness of the above key, we $$\bold{automated}$$ the decryption process of the playcipher algorithm with multiple possible keys (i.e. words) taken from the file $$\bold{"words.txt".}$$
  
      (in general, we assumed the fact that PLAYFAIR CIPHER has general English
      vocabulary as its KEY)

      "words.txt" consists of $$\bold{416296}$$ different words of varying lengths that are
      possible to be a key in Playfair cipher.

$$\bold{vi.}$$ DECRYPTION program also gave us $$\bold{"CRYPTANALYSIS"}$$  as the key.

$$\blacksquare\underline{\bold{TOOLS}} \bold{:-}$$

$$\bold{i.}$$ $$\bold{Automated program}$$ to find the KEY among the possible vocabulary words in $$\bold{"words.txt"}$$.

$$\bold{ii.}$$ Using the $$\bold{KEY}$$, we decrypted the Ciphertext by $$\bold{PLAYFAIR 
 \space cipher}$$.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------


$$\blacksquare\underline{\bold{DECRYPTION \space ALGORITHM \space}}$$ $$\bold{=>}$$  $$\bold{"PLAYFAIR \space CIPHER"}$$

$$\bold{Playfair \space cipher}$$ is a $$\underline{"digram"}$$ substitution cipher 
which follows the manual symmetric encryption technique.

$$\bullet$$The Playfair cipher uses a $$\bold{5x5}$$ matrix in which unique letters of the keyword
are filled first left to right, and subsequently, all the remaining 
unique alphabets are filled in alphabetical order.
(note:- LETTER $$\bold{"I"}$$ and $$\bold{"j"}$$ will occupy only one cell of the matrix, which enables to fit 26 alphabets in a 5*5 matrix).

$$\bullet$$Next, form the Digrams of the ciphertext, we decrypt each digram using the matrix.

$$\bullet \bold{RULES \space FOR \space DECRYPTION \space :-}$$

$$\bold{1)}$$If both the letters belong to the same row, then
 take the letter to the left of each one from the matrix 
in a WRAP-AROUND manner, respectively.
$$\bold{2)}$$If both the letters belong to the same column, then
 take the letter above to each one from the matrix 
in a WRAP-AROUND manner, respectively.
$$\bold{3)}$$If neither of the above rules is true, then 
form a quadrilateral with the two letters 
and take the letters on the other opposite diagonal respectively.




$$\blacksquare \underline{\bold{ALGORITHM}}$$:-

1)$$\bold{Score()}$$ function calculates the sum of Quadgram scores of ciphertext.

2)$$\bold{rules\_func()}$$ performs decryption using  above RULES FOR DECRYPTION.

3)$$\bold{matrix\_formation()}$$ builds a 5*5 matrix based on the KEY given.

4)Firstly, try to find the $$\bold{KEY}$$ among all possible keys from
the file $$\bold{"words.txt"}$$.

5)Iterating through each $$\underline{word}$$ (possible key),perform $$\bold{matrix\_formation()}$$ and calculate score using $$\bold{Score()}$$ function.

6)pick the $$\bold{OPTIMAL}$$ word of the high score, which serves as the
$$\bold{"KEYWORD"}$$ for our analysis.

7)Decrypt the ciphertext using KEYWORD, by performing matrix_formation(), which creates the matrix and then perform decryption digram-wise using rules_func().

s8)we get the $$\bold{decrypted Plaintext}$$.

$$\bold{End}$$

$$\blacksquare \underline{\bold{MANUAL \space CORRECTIONS}}$$  :-
$$\bold{i.}$$ As $$\bold{"X"}$$ will be attached for repeating letters during encryption 
process ,these are corrected manually.
[$$\bold{"OUTX" = > "OUT" }$$,
,$$\bold{"WILXL" = >"WILL" }$$,
$$\bold{"NEXED" = >"NEED"}$$].

$$\bold{ii.}$$ $$\bold{"IOY" = >"JOY"}$$ , as $$\bold{"J"}$$ is  substituted as $$\bold{"I"}$$ in PLAYFAIR CIPHER.
